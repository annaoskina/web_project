     <p>Japan in the period of the Meiji-Taisho faced in literature with traumatic experience of modernization. Japanese and Western culture strike as two opposite worlds: the old, rural, patriarchic and the new, urban-industrial. Loanwords as graphic equivalence (if we extend Wolf Schmid’s theory) play its special role in a narration. Loanwords mark a new world of Western influence, while small number of loanwords or their lack marks old feudal world. As we found out, in historical fiction of Mori Ogai and Akutagawa’s short novels, where he reinterpreted classical works and historical incidents, there are not loanwords of any type.</p>
     <p>Such a confrontation of these two worlds and their dynamics explain different macros, that we distinguished in 4 of 5 patterns. The patterns 1-4 demonstrates the relationship of a character with the new world, which strikes into the old one, so an author aims to solve this confrontation, find the equilibrium point between two worlds to the end of a writing. If the number of loanwords decreases to the end (pattern “Falling down”), it means that the point stays in the old world. If the number increases and has a peak in the very end (patterns “Peak in the end” and “Down and Up”), we fund this point in the new world. The difference between pattern “Peak in the middle” and “Falling down” could be explained with the different modes in narration.</p>
     <p>Katakana, romaji and kanji seems to express its special semantic. In the time, when the number of new words form many European languages flooded the Japanese language, katakana became the easiest and the most appropriate way of writing loanwords. Loanwords written with kanji looked old-fashioned and patriarchic. But as we see in Kikuchi Kan’s “Mumeisakka no nikki”, the use of kanji seems to be well-thought. Romaji looks like the most progressive way of writing, thus, Mori Ogai likes to add words in German, French and English in his philosophic and critical reflections.</p>
     <p>There are still many questions and many ways to look at the collected data. The researching of loanwords in a bigger corpus of texts or with a better metadata seems to us very perspective and promising, that is why we hope, that this research would be a small step forward to the new works.
