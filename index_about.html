     <h3>Why do we count loanwords?</h3>
   </center>
     <p>Why do we use a loanword as an atomic item? First, loan-words are clearly determined in linguistics and easy to count. Second, loanwords in Japanese historically have three basic forms of graphic: katakana, romaji (Latin script) or kanji (characters). In the period, when the rules how to write loan-words were not defined and writers had a lack of freedom in graphic, because hentaigana was not used anymore on mechanical presses, the choice of graphic (when there is a choice) could have a meaning for the author and the reader.
     </p>
     <p>It seems that the choice of loanwords’ graphic in these texts (either made by the writer or an editor) and its place in a text was a kind of message or dialog with readers and might provide some important information for understanding a text in particular and the period’s literary process as a whole. To prove it we need to look closely on these loan-words in many texts and try to find patterns.</p>
