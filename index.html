     <h3>Language and Literature in the Period of Modernization</h3>
   </center>
     <p>The Meiji period (1868–1912) inherited the book industry, which starts its history from the previous Tokugawa period. Japanese knew both types of printing: a movable type and a block printing. But soon after Meiji Restoration mechanical and then steam-powered presses replaced very popular by this time a wooden block printing [Kornicki, 1998, с. 165–166]. Although the contemporary Japanese writing system is considered to be the most difficult in the world, it was even more complicated before the Meiji Period, because of hentaigana and variations in handwriting style. New printing technologies in the Meiji period influenced the look of each character and, consequently, the look of a text as a whole. That is why the graphic in a Japanese text seems to be very important item for researching, especially in fiction as in a text not chained by rules.</p>
     <p>The research is devoted to the quantitative analyse of loan-words in the fiction in the Meiji period, but we consciously expand our time frames until the end of 20s, since the period of big changes, named in Japanese historiography the Period of Modernization, was not limited by the Meiji’s regime. The research covers writings between 1868 and 1920s and aims to answer the question, what is the message of the graphical choice in the fiction writings of that period in Japan? The research is based on a dataset of texts, written by Japanese writers in Japanese and published in Japan in the time of Modernization. The necessity of the research is determined by the research interest to the development of Japanese literature in the time of significant influence of Western countries on Japan. Regarding Lev Manovich the importance of having large cultural datasets consists in constructing of “a representative sample of a cultural field, we can use it to find general trends and patterns” [Manovich, 2016, с. 6]. In opposite to close reading Franko Moretti claims that distant reading “allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text” [Moretti, 2013, с. 48]. This research concerns graphic of loan-words in Japanese literature exactly with this aim.</p>
